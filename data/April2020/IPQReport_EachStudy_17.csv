Awareness is; however; rather low. Our research objective was to investigate whether coping responses to flooding risks could be enhanced in a virtual environment (VE). A laboratory experiment was conducted in which participants were exposed to a simulated dike breach and consequent flooding of their virtual residence. We tested the hypothesis that an interactive 3D flood simulation facilitates coping responses compared to noninteractive film and slide �,,,-3.54,-0.25285715,FALSE,911,911,911,911,911,911,911,911,Projection Display,5-point,Fair,Each Study,52.46
